## 数据获取

- [X] 美国人口特征数据
- [ ] 疫苗供应量（州、时间）
- [ ] 疫苗注射量（州、时间）
- [ ] 获病人群职业划分
- [ ] 免疫持续时间
- [ ] *疫苗分流程免疫率*


## 1. 当下疫情情况

1. 近期按州分析
2. 年龄，性别，种族，职业
3. 总人数，死亡率，医院收容率
4. Presence of underlying comorbidity or disease

## 2. 群体免疫

### 2.1. 为什么有效

群体免疫的条件:

$$接种率 \geq \frac{1-\frac{1}{R_0}}{E} $$
$R_0=2.2, E$ 是疫苗有效率。

> The ECDC uses an estimated herd immunity threshold of 67% for its models, while Chancellor Angela Merkel said this month that COVID-19 restrictions in Germany could be lifted if 60% to 70% of the population acquired immunity, either via a COVID-19 vaccine or through infection.

>World Health Organization experts have also pointed to a 65%-70% vaccine coverage rate as a way to reach population immunity through vaccination.

> “The idea of herd community is to protect the vulnerable,” said Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh. “And the idea behind it is that if, say, 98% of a population have all been vaccinated, there will be so little virus in the community that the 2% will be protected. That’s the point of it.”
